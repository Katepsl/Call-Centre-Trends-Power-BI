# Call-Centre-Trends-Power-BI

# Overview

This project is designed to analyze and visualize call center trends, with a focus on key metrics such as customer satisfaction, call response times, and agent performance. The dashboard provides an interactive overview, allowing call center managers to track and improve operational efficiency by analyzing patterns in call handling and customer feedback.

# Dataset Description

The dataset used for this analysis contains the following columns:

Call Id: A unique identifier for each call.
Agent: The name of the agent who handled the call.
Date: The date the call was made.
Time: The time the call occurred.
Topic: The primary issue or reason for the call.
Answered (Y/N): Whether the call was answered (Y for Yes, N for No).
Resolved: Whether the call issue was resolved (Y for Yes, N for No).
Speed of Answer (in seconds): The time it took for the call to be answered, measured in seconds.
AvgTalkDuration: The average time spent talking on the call, measured in minutes.
Satisfaction Rating: A rating provided by the customer, typically on a scale of 1 to 5.
Avg Talk Duration: The average duration of the call.

# Key Metrics in the Dashboard

Overall Customer Satisfaction:

A gauge visualization showing the average satisfaction rating out of 5, based on customer feedback.

Calls by Time:

A horizontal bar chart illustrating the number of calls handled during different hours of the day. This helps identify peak times for call volume.

Average Speed of Answer:

A key performance indicator (KPI) showing the average time taken to answer a call in seconds. Lower values indicate quicker response times, contributing to better customer service.

Overall Calls Answered/Abandoned:

A pie chart representing the percentage of calls that were answered versus those that were abandoned, providing a high-level view of call handling efficiency.

Count of Answered/Abandoned Calls by Agents:

A tree map that visualizes the performance of individual agents in terms of the number of calls answered and abandoned. This helps track agent efficiency and identify areas for training or support.

Average Speed of Answer by Time:

A line chart showing the average speed of answer at different times of the day, allowing managers to pinpoint when service response times are slower.
Requirements

To build and use this dashboard, you will need the following tools:

# Conclusion

This dashboard helps call center managers:

Monitor customer satisfaction levels.
Track call volume patterns across different times of the day.
Measure agent performance in terms of call answering and abandonment rates.
Evaluate operational efficiency with the average speed of answer.
By using these insights, managers can adjust staffing levels, improve agent training, and enhance overall customer service.

# Future Work

Predictive Analytics: Incorporate machine learning to predict potential customer churn based on dissatisfaction and unresolved issues.
Advanced Reporting: Expand the dashboard to include detailed reports on each agent's performance over specific time periods.
Call Topic Analysis: Perform a deeper analysis of call topics to identify frequent issues and improve resolution strategies.
